# Forbidden Paths

## Description
Can you get the flag?
We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

After reading the challenge description, I realized that since absolute paths are blocked so I needed to use relative path to navigate to the root directory by using `../` repeatedly because I knew that it is used to navigate to the parent directory.
To reach `/flag.txt` from the `/usr/share/nginx/html/` directory using relative path, I kept the following directory structure in mind: `/usr/share/nginx/html/` -> `/usr/share/nginx` -> `/usr/share` -> `/usr` -> `/` and entered `../../../../flag.txt` as the filename in the desired field on the website.
Through this approach, I managed to bypass the absolute path filter returning the flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`.

When I accessed the website, I initially tried entering names of various cookie brands in the given field, but nothing happened. 
I then started inspecting the website's `Application` tab and found that there was a cookie already present with the `Name` set as `name` and its `Value` set to `-1`. 
After analyzing the cookie, I realized that the preset value needed to be changed to access other web pages. 
Upon hitting and trying various values, I discovered that setting the value to `18` revealed the flag: `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}`.
