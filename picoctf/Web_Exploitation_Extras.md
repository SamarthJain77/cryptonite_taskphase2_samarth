- The flag may or may not be encoded

## Writeup
Upon accessing the website, I landed on the `HOME` page which had some text and an image which was shared randomly for the purpose of trolling.
I then started inspecting the page's source code and backend files but found nothing pertinent to the challenge.
Then I navigated to the `ABOUT` page where it was mentioned `Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there`.
Upon inspecting the page, I noticed that it contained a base64 encoded string in the `Elements` tab. I then decoded it using the online decoder found at https://base64.guru/converter/decode/text, which led me to the flag: `picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_f6f6b78a}`.

# Unminify

## Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

## Hints
- Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.
- Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
- What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

I then started inspecting the website's source code and backend files and found that the flag was defined in the `index.html` file as `<p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_d9c45a0b}"></p>`, which led me to the flag: `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_d9c45a0b}`.

## Hints
- Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
- Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

## Writeup
After reading the challenge description and the given hints, I realized that I needed to do something with Burp Suite and web request interception.
On surfing the internet, I learned about `Burp Suite`, a proxy program that enables us to track, examine, and alter requests made by our browsers before they are forwarded to a distant server.
It is a prominent web application security solution which gives us the ability to manually test for vulnerabilities, intercept HTTP messages, and change a message's body and header.
I downloaded it and imported the website as the `target` to understand various requests being forwarded to the server and the response generated to them.
Upon accessing the website, I noticed that it had a request created with the method as `GET` which meant that data was being requested from the server and I was directed to the `Registration` page which was asking for certain details.
I gave some random details as the input which created a request with the method as `POST`.
It meant that the data was being sent to the server for processing.
I again noticed that a request was created with the method as `GET` and I was redirected to the `2fa authentication` page which was asking for a One Time Password (OTP).
I gave some random number as the input which created a request with the method as `POST` and displayed the output as `Invalid OTP`.
I understood that I needed to exploit this request to retrieve the flag by submitting a modified request.
To edit this request, I started looking for relevant options and settings. 
After some trial and error, I discovered the `Send to Repeater` option under the `Request` menu.
In the body of the request, I noticed that the `otp` variable was defined with its value set to the input I had provided earlier.
Then I sent the request to the server with modified values but none of them worked.
This made me think whether the server considered the `OTP` field as a mandatory column to fill.
So based on the identified logic, I removed the instance of the `otp` variable and sent the request, which led me to the flag: `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_c94b61ac}`.
