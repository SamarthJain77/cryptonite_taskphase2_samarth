## Writeup
Upon accessing the website, I landed on the `HOME` page which had some text and an image which was shared randomly for the purpose of trolling.
I then started inspecting the page's source code and backend files but found nothing pertinent to the challenge.
Then I navigated to the `ABOUT` page where it was mentioned `Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there`.
Upon inspecting the page, I noticed that it contained a base64 encoded string in the `Elements` tab. I then decoded it using the online decoder found at https://base64.guru/converter/decode/text, which led me to the flag: `picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_f6f6b78a}`.

# Unminify

## Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

## Hints
- Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.
- Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
- What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

Upon accessing the website, I landed on a page which had some text and an image but nothing was pertinent to the challenge.
I then started inspecting the website's source code and backend files and found that the flag was defined in the `index.html` file as `<p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_d9c45a0b}"></p>`, which led me to the flag: `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_d9c45a0b}`.
