## Writeup
After reading the challenge description and the given hints, I realized that I needed to do something with the format specifiers.
Format specifiers are used in C programming language to take input and display the output of a specific type. 
We use the `%` symbol in every format specifier. 
Format specifiers tell the compiler about the type of data that must be taken as input and the type of data that must be printed on the screen as output. 
On connecting with the challenge instance, I got to know that we are roleplaying in a newly-opened burger place `Pico 'n Patty`! 
My work was to help the picky customers find their favorite burger. 
The first customer was `Patrick` who wanted a giant bite. 
I had to choose a burger from the following options: `Breakf@st_Burger`, `Gr%114d_Cheese`, `Bac0n_D3luxe`. 
I kept in mind the format specifiers and chose `Gr%114d_Cheese`. 
Patrick went away happily and second customer `Sponge Bob` arrived who wanted something outrageous that would break the shop. 
I had to choose a burger from the following options: `Pe%to_Portobello`, `$outhwest_Burger`, `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak`. 
Again keeping in mind the format specifiers, I chose `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` which led me to the flag: `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4}`.
